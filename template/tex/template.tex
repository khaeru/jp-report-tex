\section{Introduction}

This note documents version 1.2 of the JP \LaTeX\, template that provides an
efficient and rapid way to turn your research paper into a JP Report. This
template formats your document to be consistent with the official formatting
guidelines of the MIT Joint Program Report Series. Most importantly, it frees up
additional research time by avoiding resource-intensive battles with MS-Word.
This template is based on the word processing software \LaTeX, which is open
source software; the latest version of the JP \LaTeX\, template is available
online at the JP Wiki page.

This note is primarily concerned with providing an alternative option to format
your JP Report. As such, it should be seen as complementing the existing MS-Word
JP template document ``\emph{JP Report Preparation Guidelines for Authors}'' by
Anne Slinn and Gwendolyn Kelso. The remainder of this document showcases the
\LaTeX\, template and provides a brief description of how to implement this new
package. If there are suggestions for how to improve the usefulness or accuracy
of this template, or the accompanying template document, please email comments
to the authors of this note.

\section{File Structure of the JP \LaTeX\, Package}

The JP \LaTeX\, package can be found on the JP Wiki Report Series Information 
webpage. It consists of the following files: 
\begin{description}
  \item[\ttfamily jp-report.sty] controls all formatting and layout
  parameters. Do not modify this file and keep it in the same directory as your
  JP report!
  \item[\ttfamily template.tex] This is the core file
  that was used to create the PDF file called \textit{JP\_Report\_template.pdf}
  that you are currently reading. You can use it as a template by inserting the
  text of your report. 
  \item[\ttfamily example.bib] This file contains the bibliography
  items used in this document and serves as a template for your JP report
  bibliography. This file should be stored in the same directory as your JP
  report. You can add references here following the format described in the
  bibliography section of this document.
  \item[\ttfamily jpreport.bst] defines the style of the bibliography. Do not
  modify this file and keep it in the same directory as your JP report!
\end{description}

\section{Submission Guidelines}
Joint Program Reports are usually required to be authored (or co-authored) by
personnel affiliated with the Joint Program. The content is generally expected
to be an article that has been prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed outlet
(journal or book chapter).

The general procedure for contributing a paper to the Report Series is the
following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Authors should first confer with John Reilly (Policy/Economics) or Anne
  Slinn (Science) to determine if the paper is suitable to be included in the
  Report Series.
  \item If given the ``go-ahead'', authors prepare their paper for production 
  according to the guidelines in this document. Authors are individually 
  responsible for the proper formatting and editing of their papers.
  \item The author will then email the ``print-ready'' paper as a PDF file to 
  Fran Goldstein (\href{mailto:fkg@mit.edu}{fkg@mit.edu}) for format review. 
  The paper must be delivered in PDF format. \LaTeX\, allows you to directly 
  create a PDF document from the source code. Please ensure that all graphics 
  in the PDF document are sharp and clear images. (The process of saving as, or 
  converting to, a PDF file may involve option-settings that can default to 
  `down-sampling' graphics, which reduces image quality/resolution to reduce 
  file-size.) If the paper meets all formatting criteria, it will go into the 
  production process.
  \item If the paper does not match the formatting criteria (unlikely to be the 
  case if you use this new template \emph{without} modifying it, and if you 
  know how to use \LaTeX), it will be sent back to the author for correction 
  (may take several rounds).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Basic Functionalities of the JP \LaTeX\, Package}

\subsection{Headings}

To do a section, subsection, or subsubsection heading, simply type:
\begin{verbatim}
\section{Headings}
\subsection{Headings}
\subsection{Headings}
\end{verbatim}
The format of the headings (font size, capitalization, font type, numbering, 
spacing before and after the heading etc.) is controlled by the template.

\subsubsection{Paragraph Attributes}

A new paragraph is specified by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
\par
\end{verbatim}
\ldots or simply by leaving a blank line between two blocks of text:
\begin{verbatim}
Here is one sentence.
Here is a second sentence, part of the same paragraph.

This sentence appears in a new paragraph.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Specific Sections}

\subsubsection{Title Page}

The whole title page including the title of the paper, the author list, 
abstract, and table of contents is created automatically. Simply insert the 
information in the respective customized fields:
\begin{verbatim}
\title{}
\author{}
\affil{}
\abstract{}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Table of Contents}

The table of contents together with the page numbers is generated automatically 
from the section headings included in the document by the command 
\verb@\tableofcontents@. Do not remove that command from the template.

\subsubsection{Tables}

An example how to generate the following \textbf{Table \ref{table:topdown_var}} 
can be found in the source code. To reference a table the command is as 
follows. First, create a label for the table as in:
\begin{verbatim}
\label{table:label}
\end{verbatim}
Then any reference to this table can be made by:
\begin{verbatim}
Table \ref{table:label}
\end{verbatim}.
Boldface the first reference to a table in the text by using the command 
\begin{verbatim}
\textbf{Table \ref{table:label}}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Regional Price Elasticities for Fuel Supply and Electricity Demand.}
\label{table:elas_bernstein}
\small\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{%
  X % this is to specific automatic column width
  S[table-format=1.2]% Define the format of the numbers in the column 
  S[table-format=1.2]% This allows for decimal point alignment
  S[table-format=1.2]%
  S[table-format=1.2]%
  }
  \toprule
  \tableheader{1}{L}{Region} &
    \tableheader{2}{c}{$\eta^z_r$ (simulated)$\,^a$} &
    \tableheader{1}{C}{$\epsilon_r$ (simulated)$\,^a$} &
    \tableheader{1}{C}{$\epsilon_r$ (estimated)} \\
% use \tableheader to input the headers of the columns as such:
% \tableheader{#column}{alignment}{text}
% where
% #column is 1 unless using multicolumn header like in this example;
% alignment is either: L, C or R for (left align, centered, right align). Note 
% that if #column is greater than 1, you should use l, c or r in lowercase;
% text is the header text (it will automatically be bolded).
  \cmidrule{2-3} &
    \tableheader{1}{C}{Coal} &
    \tableheader{1}{C}{Natural gas} & & \\
  \midrule
  CA    & 0.01 & 0.02 & -50.47 & -0.25 \\
  ERCOT & 0.01 & 0.04 & -0.435 & -0.15 \\
  MISO  & 0.03 & 0.01 & -0.24  & -0.14 \\
  MOUNT & 0.01 & 0.02 & -0.37  & -0.20 \\
  NENGL & 0.01 & 0.01 & -0.72  & -0.19 \\
  NWPP  & 0.09 & 0.01 & -0.43  & -0.23 \\
  NY    & 0.01 & 0.01 & -0.17  & -0.10 \\
  PJM   & 0.04 & 0.01 & -0.23  & -0.22 \\
  SEAST & 0.05 & 0.01 & -0.32  & -0.25 \\
  SPP   & 0.01 & 0.01 & -0.50  & -0.15 \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Figures}

An example how to generate the following \textbf{Figure 
\ref{fig:mapregionalaggregation}} can be found in the source code. To reference 
a figure the command is as follows. First, create a label for the figure as in:
\begin{verbatim}
\label{fig:label_name}
\end{verbatim}
Then any reference to this table can be made by:
\begin{verbatim}
Figure \ref{fig:label_name}
\end{verbatim}.
Boldface the first reference to a figure in the text by using the command:
\begin{verbatim}
\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:label_name}}
\end{verbatim}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \noindent\includegraphics[width=13cm]{MapUS12.jpg}\\
  \caption{U.S. Regions in Integrated Economic-Electricity Model.}\label{fig:mapregionalaggregation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Equations}

Creating equations in \LaTeX\, is simple. You can find the \LaTeX\, coding following equations in the source code of this document:
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\text{ELE}^{\text{F}}_r + \sum_{\text{NF}} \text{ELE}^{\text{NF}}_r = \text{D}^{\text{ELE}}_r \quad \perp \quad P^{\text{ELE}}_r
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
\frac{\partial \overline{u}}{\partial t}=f\overline{v}^\star-\frac{\overline{v}^\star}{a\cos \phi} \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \left(\overline{u} \cos \phi \right)-\overline{w}^\star \overline{u}_{z}+\frac{1}{\rho_{0} a \cos \phi}\nabla\cdot\vec{F}+\overline{X}
\end{equation}
For more details on the full functionality of the math package go and read the documentation at: \url{ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf}.


\subsubsection{Footnotes}

To do footnotes,\footnote{This is footnote text. This is footnote text.} simply
type:
\begin{verbatim}
\footnote{This is footnote text This is footnote text.}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Acknowlegments}

The acknowledgments go right before the bibliography using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
\acknowledgments{}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Bibliography}

You can store your bibliography in BibTeX format and call it using the 
following command, which should be placed after the acknowledgments but before 
the appendices:
\begin{verbatim}
\bibliography{name_of_bibliography_file}
\end{verbatim}

The reference is then cited using the commands {\footnotesize\verb|\citet|} and 
{\footnotesize\verb|\citep|} for textual and parenthetical citations, 
respectively:

\bigskip

\noindent{\footnotesize\verb|\citet{Reilly2007}|} produces: \citet{Reilly2007}\\
\noindent{\footnotesize\verb|\citep{Webster2003}|} produces: \citep{Webster2003}

\bigskip

Example bibliography entries for the various types of references are given 
below. The full bibliography database can be found in the 
\textit{template\_bibliography.bib} file located in the JP \LaTeX\, template 
package. Last, the resultant formatted references are given at the end of this 
document in the references section. Authors should use the example database 
entry to determine what information is necessary to have a properly formatted 
reference in JP report style.
